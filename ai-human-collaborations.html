				<p>If there is one continuous theme in the laws regarding AI and copyright, it is the concept that creativity is uniquely human.  To provide copyright protection for AI generated works, most countries take into consideration the amount of human involvement in the project.  So what does human collaboration with Artificial Intelligence look like?

				<h3>Using AI to Restore Art</h3>
				
				<p>Machine learning has been used to restore a variety of lost, damaged, or unfinished art pieces.   AI has been able to restore Beethoven's 10th symphony using machine learning trained on Beethoven’s completed works and the unfinished human composition.  Then, human experts chose the best fit to release as the final restored composition (Li, 2022). 

Google’s Arts & Culture division has collaborated with museums across the world to digitize hundreds of paintings, drawings, and other cultural heritage pieces that had not previously been digitized.  As an outgrowth of that project, Google worked with museum curators to train an AI model that could replicate lost paintings (Gaskin, S. 2021). 

	Painter Gustav Klimt’s “Faculty Paintings” collection was stolen and destroyed by the Nazis.  Using black and white photos of the original paintings and machine learning trained on other paintings of Klimt’s, as well as scholarly evaluations of the artist’s work, Google was able to show the world what these lost art pieces could have looked like (Gaskin S. 2021).  Many other partially destroyed or lost art pieces have also been restored using Artificial Intelligence in recent years (Li, 2022).   

These types of restoration projects make use of art historians' knowledge as well as the efficiency of AI predictions to fill in the gaps.  While human restoration work can be influenced by the person’s mood or personal interpretation, AI restoration offers a dispassionate recreation based on patterns in the original artist’s work (Li, 2022).   

 

Copyright and Collaboration 

	As discussed in more detail in the history of AI and copyright [link to page], AI creations have largely been excluded from copyright protections.  Many countries have left the door open to protect joint works created by humans working with AI.  However, the exact details of how that kind of copyright protection would be granted are still murky.   

	While human/AI collaboration is touted by many as the future of art the confusion over the copyright of works containing AI is one of the many factors preventing professional adaptation of AI as a tool.   

	Photographers who make use of generative fill tools to remove unwanted items from their photos could potentially lose their copyright by disclosing their use of AI (Gooding, 2024).  Champions of AI argue that using AI will help artist work faster and more efficiently (Marr, 2024).  However, if any use of AI causes a work to fall into public domain, artists will be weary to adopt such tools.  The copyrightability of joint human and AI works must be solved before these tools can become a major part of any creative workflow.   

The use of AI in art restoration projects has also raised concerns over the role of copyright in restoration.  Art restoration is already a gray area in copyright law.  It is usually done on pieces that already exist in the public domain due to their age.  Some argue that restoration experts should copyright their work to encourage museums to restore art and benefit monetarily from it.  However, much like AI generated items, restoration itself is not considered to be a full work of art (Li, 2022).   

These specially created and trained AIs doing specialized tasks such as art restoration certainly seem to fit well in the copyrightable niche of human and AI collaboration.  However, who would receive that copyright?  The programmer? The museum that holds the original art? Curators, artists, and restoration experts who work on content used to train the AI model (Li, 2022)?  These issues are still being debated in the wider field of AI and copyright with no clear answers.  Copyrighting AI restorations of historical works of art could result in tech companies profiting from restored art pieces and doing harm to the mission of museums and cultural heritage institutions (Li, 2022).

            <h2>Summary</h2>
			
            <p>A key topic in global conversations about AI and copyright law is the belief that creativity is inherently a human characteristic. Consequently, most AI-generated works are not eligible for copyright protection unless there is a significant human contribution. Projects that merge human effort with AI, such as art restoration, illustrate how AI can enhance creative efforts while still involving humans. For instance, AI has been used to help reconstruct lost works like Beethoven's 10th Symphony and Gustav Klimt's destroyed paintings. This process involves AI examining the original artists' stylistic patterns, with insights from human historians and curators.
			
			However, copyright law is struggling to keep pace with these technological advancements. Many countries are unsure how to handle works jointly created by humans and AI, leading to confusion among artists and organizations. This uncertainty poses a major hurdle for the professional use of AI in creative fields—photographers and artists risk losing their copyrights when they use AI features. Even in the field of restoration, where AI is used to recreate works from the public domain, questions about ownership of the final product persist: do the rights go to the developers, the museums, or the curators? Without clearer legislation, collaborations between humans and AI remain mired in legal ambiguity.</p>
