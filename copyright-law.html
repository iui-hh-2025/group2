            <h2>A History of AI and Copyright</h2>
				
				<p>The general goal of Artificial Intelligence is to create computers with software that enables them to act more and more human.  This would let AI complete tasks in a fraction of the time required by a human (Ahuja & Kumar 2024).  In recent history, AI has been able to attempt many human skills like writing or creating images.  With AI doing more and more human activities, it has become necessary to adjust laws regarding creation and intellectual property to include the involvement of Artificial Intelligence.</p>

					<h3>United States</h3>

						<p>In the United States of America, the AI and copyright discussion has centered around the human element of creativity.  Much of this discussion has been inspired by a near decade long legal dispute concerning a self-portrait taken by a monkey.  Ultimately courts in the US and UK ruled that copyright law is intended to protect and encourage human creativity, therefore the image fell into the public domain as it was not created by a human (Stewart, 2016).</p>  

						<p>In early 2025, the Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit, ruled that to be eligible for copyright protection, all works must be authored by a human being.   This means that, for now at least, works created by Artificial Intelligence are in the Public Domain in America.</p> 
						
						<p>The United States has no regulations guiding what works can or cannot be used to train AI models.  Any complaints of copyright infringement on the case of creators whose content was used in training AI are dealt with on a case-by-case basis under the Fair Use doctrine (Warren & Grasser, 2024).</p>
					</div>

					<h3>European Union</h3>

						<p>In the EU, the legal landscape seems to be more favorable to GenAI content.  The focus in EU courts is more on clarifying the status of GenAI works so that the right people, if any, can receive proper compensation for their work (Vishnu, 2024).  The 2019 update to the EU’s copyright directive granted potential copyright protection to AI generated works that “meet creativity standards” (Hoshiar & Kiran 2024, p4).  This would potentially mean copyright for GenAI materials lies with the programmer of the AI model.</p>
						
						<p>Most recently, in 2024 an EU court in Czechoslovakia ruled directly on AI and copyright, becoming the first EU court to do so.  The court decided that AI cannot receive copyright protection.  However, the EU court has left the door open for GenAI content to receive copyright protection in the future if the creation process involves more in-depth human involvement than just typing a prompt (Novograaf 2024).</p>

						<p>When it comes to training AI models, the EU requires this to be done for non-commercial purposes only.  Individual countries within the EU have ongoing legal cases to determine some commercial uses for training generative AI, particularly for commercial research activities, though this is largely on a case-by-case basis (Warren & Grasser, 2024).</p>

			<h2>Other International Stances on AI and Copyright</h2>
			 
					<div class="left">
					<img src="images/flags/australia.png" alt="National flag of Australia">
					<h3>Australia</h3>
					 
						<p>Australian copyright law prohibits copyright for computer generated content (Hoshiar & Kiran, 2024).  However, there is no such prohibition for Artificial Intelligence being credited as an inventor.  In the legal dispute over the AI system DABUS, one judge has ruled that the AI could be considered a co-inventor.  While that decision was eventually overturned by another judge, opinions are still divided on the matter (Ahuja & Kumar, 2024).</p>
					</div>
 
					<div class="right">
					<img src="images/flags/china.png" alt="National flag of China">
					<h3>China</h3>

						<p>Chinese copyright law has been proactive in making decisions related to AI (Zhuk, 2024). Chinese law requires humans, typically in inventor of a GenAI program, to participate “significantly” in the creative process in order for the resulting content to receive copyright protection (Hoshiar & Kiran, 2024, p. 4).   Chinese law allows for copyright to be determined beforehand and agreed upon in contracts and their proactive approach to AI issues in copyright means that the Chinese legal system is now working to create objective measurements for human and AI contributions (Zhuk, 2024).</p>
					</div>
					 
					<div class="left">
					<img src="images/flags/india.png" alt="National flag of India">
					<h3>India</h3>

						<p>Indian law is still debating how GenAI works should be treated.  Some have been works created by AI granted copyright protection while others have not.  This is because some judges have interpreted AI as a person and others have rejected this idea (Vishnu, 2024).  In the case of GenAI content created with human input, Indian copyright goes to the human directing the AI (Hoshiar & Kiran, 2024, p. 4).</p>
					</div> 
					 
					<div class="right">
					<img src="images/flags/japan.png" alt="National flag of Japan"> 
					<h3>Japan</h3>

						<p>Japanese Copyright Act requires works express “human thoughts and emotions” in order to be eligible for protection (Warren & Grasser, 2024, para. 19).  Most Japanese copyright decisions in recent years have focused on regulating what content can be used for AI training and for what purposes.  In 2019, Japan allowed copyrighted content to be used to train AI for any purpose.  The 2024 proposed updates to these laws were spurred by protests from artists.  The 2024 update limits copyrighted materials to be used to train Artificial Intelligence only for analytical purposes (not creative).  It also included protection for copyright holders should they be harmed by content created by AI trained on their works (Warren & Grasser, 2024).</p>
					</div> 
					 
					<div class="left">
					<img src="images/flags/singapore.png" alt="National flag of Singapore">
					<h3>Singapore</h3>

						<p>Singaporian law is unusual in that it already has a clear stance on AI authorship.  Singapore has a does not entertain the possibility of AI being a creator.  Their law clearly states that copyright is for human creations alone (Hoshiar & Kiran, 2024).  Singapore is also in the process of regulating “trusted data” that can be used for training AI models (Warren & Grasser, 2024).</p>
					</div>
					 
					<div class="right">
					<img src="images/flags/taiwan.png" alt="National flag of Taiwan">
					<h3>Taiwan</h3>

						<p>AI generated content falls into “community property” in Taiwan (Hoshiar & Kiran, 2024, p. 4).</p>
					</div>
					 
					<div class="left">
					<img src="images/flags/ukraine.png" alt="National flag of Ukraine"> 
					<h3>Ukraine</h3>

						<p>Ukrainian law avoids the term “Artificial Intelligence” preferring broader terms like “computer technologies” and “computer programme[s]” which allow the law to cover new technologies (Bulat, 2024 p. 11-12). Ukrainian copyright law offers limited protections for “non-original objects” generated by computers and traditional copyright for human creations made with computer assistance. However, the vague wording of Ukrainian Law leaves who benefits from these protections up to interpretation (Bulat, 2024, p.14).</p>
					</div>
					 
					 
					<div class="right">
					<img src="images/flags/uk.png" alt="National flag of the United Kingdom">
					<h3>United Kingdom</h3>

						<p>UK law gives copyright to AI generated content to the individual who set up the AI (Hoshiar & Kiran, 2024, p. 4).  The idea is that authorship is based on control of the creative process rather than the creator itself in the case of Artificial Intelligence (Bulat, 2024).  Like the EU, the United Kingdom limits scraping for AI training to non-commercial use.</p>

			<h2>So What Now?</h2>
				
				<p>As it stands right now, the general consensus around the world is that creation of original, copyrightable art requires some form of human involvement.  Because of the nature of GenAI it is difficult to determine what counts as “enough” human involvement.  Without an international agreement on what that looks like, GenAI will continue to exist in a gray area between copyright and public domain.</p>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
			
				<p>The swift advancement of artificial intelligence, especially its growing ability to produce creative outputs like writing and art, has sparked extensive discussions on copyright laws worldwide. In the U.S., copyright is exclusively for human creators, meaning AI-generated works are immediately placed in the public domain, while disputes over training data are evaluated under the Fair Use doctrine. On the other hand, the European Union takes a slightly more adaptable stance, allowing copyright for Generative AI works if there is significant human contribution, though what qualifies as "significant" still needs to be clearly defined by the courts.</p>

				<p>Nations like Japan and Singapore enforce strict rules regarding human authorship in their copyright legislation, guaranteeing that only works with direct human involvement are protected. In contrast, China and India offer more complex or developing interpretations, indicating their continuous adjustment to the ever-changing AI environment. A few countries, including Ukraine and Taiwan, use more inclusive or community-focused legal terminology to cover AI-generated works, whereas the United Kingdom grants copyright to the person managing the AI process.</p>

				<p>At present, there is no worldwide agreement on how to handle AI-generated content, and the vital issue of defining "sufficient" human involvement is still unsettled. Until a universal guideline is developed, content created by Generative AI will persist in a legal ambiguity, with copyright protections differing significantly from one region to another. </p>
