            <h2>Opinions on AI, Creativity, and Copyright </h2>
			
				<p>People around the world have a wide range of thoughts and opinions about AI's use in creating material and about the copyright questions that go along with the topic. Here are some comments about the subject from a few famous and influential individuals.</p>
				
				<h3>Celebrities</h3>
				
				    <h4>James Cameron (Filmmaker)</h4> 

						<p>The famed filmmaker finds that while AI can certainly be used in a negative aspect, it has great potential when it is used properly to ease the workflow of creators. “I think the whole thing [whether or not to train AI models with copyrighted material] needs to be managed from a legal perspective, as to what’s the output, not what’s the input” (Weprin, 2025, para. 2, 11).</p> 

					<h4>Guillermo del Toro (Filmmaker)</h4>

						<p>The filmmaker argues that AI is unable to replicate the value of creativity and as such, fails to capture the allure of an art or a script. AI may be a tool, but it cannot create on its own (Barfield, 2024, para. 3 – 7).</p> 

					<h4>Hayao Miyazaki  (Filmmaker)</h4>

						<p>“Whoever creates this stuff has no idea what pain is whatsoever. I am utterly disgusted… I strongly feel that this is an insult to life itself” (XEU 2024; Hayao Miyazaki, 2016).</p>

					<h4>Tom Hanks (Actor)</h4> 

						<p>The iconic actor points out that while there are major hurdles regarding unauthorized usage of their likeness and voice and establishing safeguards, the prospect of having an actor being able to continue having an on-screen presence makes the risk worth it. “Without a doubt, people will be able to tell [that it’s AI], but the question is will they care? There are some people that won’t care, that won’t make that delineation.” (Buxton, 2023, 36:35).</p> 

					<h4>Simon Cowell (Executive)</h4>

						<p>“I really do embrace the future. However, I also believe that you have to be fair. And I’m only writing this because I passionately care about people’s personal creativity, and AI shouldn’t be able to steal the talent of those humans who created the magic in the first place” (Cowell,  2025, para 13).</p>

					<h4>Ashton Kutcher (Actor)</h4>

						<p>The former actor has seemingly invested in an AI company Sound Ventures during the recent rise of genAI.  “This is going to change business forever, and we need to embrace it because, right now, this AI can be used to improve humanity” (Shanfeld, 2024, para. 8).</p>

					<h4>Eva Toorenent (Artist)</h4>

						<p>The artist fears that “Artists using this technology in this way take advantage of their peers and fellow creatives. We should resist normalising the use of a technology that’s fundamentally rotten” (Combrinck, 2025, para. 29).</p>

				<h3>Business Leaders</h3> 

					<h4>Mark Getty</h4>  

						<p>The cofounder of Getty Images finds that because AI uses human created content to function in the first place, the human made content must be protected. “It’s not innovation. It’s exploitation” (The Times, 2025, para. 5)</p>

					<h4>Bill Gates</h4>

						<p>The former CEO and founder of Microsoft is quite eager about the technological advancements of genAI. “The development of AI is as fundamental as the creation of the microprocessor, the personal computer, the Internet, and the mobile phone. It will change the way people work, learn, travel, get health care, and communicate with each other” (Gates, 2023, para. 9).</p>

					<h4>Mustafa Suleyman</h4> 

						<p>The current CEO of Microsoft’s AI department and former CEO of Google’s DeepMind AI development team remarked that fears of genAI copyright infringement are overblown. “With respect to content that is already on the open web, the social contract of that content since the 90s has been that it is fair use. Anyone can copy it, recreate with it, reproduce with it. That has been freeware, if you like. That's been the understanding” (Endicott, 2024, para. 2-3).</p>

			<h2>So Much to Think About!</h2>
				<p>There are probably as many opinions about AI as there are people. Everyone has a unique perspective, and of course, not everyone agrees about everything.</p>
				<p>It is interesting, though, to look at the different perspectives on the topic as we try to gain a better understanding of how AI should (and should not) be used, and also of how to use it in a way that is beneficial without harming others.</p>
