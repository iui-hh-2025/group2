						Artificial Intelligence or AI is the hottest buzzword in coding and electronics right now. It seems like everything from Google&apos;s search results to household appliances has AI now. Some AI, like spell check, has been part of our lives for a long time now.  The newer, flashier use of artificial intelligence is generative AI or GenAI. GenAI uses internet content to train machine learning to then create new content.
					</p>
				
					<p>
						GenAI has been a source of entertainment and discourse since programs like Dall-E 3 and ChatGPT were released to the public. Programmers have been trying to use computers to make art since the early days of computing (Ahuja &amp; Kumar, 2024). Now that GenAI is able to produce images and text with a simple prompt from the user, we, as a society, are faced with many questions. Is AI able to create art? Is the process of AI sourcing reference images Fair Use or does it infringe on the rights of artists who have showcased their work online? Can writing, images, or music generated through AI be copyrighted? Should it be copyrightable? If so, who should hold the copyright for media created by GenAI?
					</p>
				
					<p>
						Some of these questions have been asked in courtrooms around the world already. Others are still being debated.  This is an ongoing issue, developing along with the technology in question. On this website you will find a brief history of AI, summaries of where the law currently stands, and discussions on the ethics of GenAI. It is impossible to present a single view on this complex and evolving topic. However, this page attempts to distill the most current information on the topic in a concise and readable format.

            <h2>What is Copyright? What is Fair Use? Why does it matter to me?</h2>
			
            <p>Copyright law exists to foster creativity in society because creativity benefits society as a whole (Centivany, 2024). Copyright protects artists so they can continue to create without worrying about having their ideas stolen. Copyright, like any other law, must be updated to reflect modern life and technological advances (Centivany, 2024).</p>
  
			<p>Fair Use is another legal precedent connected to copyright. Fair Use allows for the use of copyrighted material in limited quantities for purposes that are typically non-commercial (What Is Fair Use, N.D.). Fair Use allows for search engines to show preview images of products and individuals to record prime time programming to view at a later date (Centivany, 2024). If you watch YouTubers discuss movies, streamers play video games or book reviews on BookTok, you have experienced another expression of Fair Use.</p>  

			<p>Copyright and Fair Use balance protections for creators and users of media. Understanding copyright and fair use is important for creators and users at all levels. GenAI has raised new questions about the nature of copyright, creativity, and humanity.</p>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
			
            <p>	Copyright law is designed to encourage creativity by protecting artists' works from unauthorized use. It is a constantly evolving field that must keep up with rapid technological changes.</p>
  
			<p>Within this structure, Fair Use plays a vital role by permitting limited use of copyrighted material without permission, as long as it is for non-commercial purposes like reviews or search previews. This careful balance aims to align the rights of creators with the needs of users.</p>  

			<p>As technologies like Generative AI advance, they spark new conversations and debates about creativity and the changing nature of copyright law. </p>
